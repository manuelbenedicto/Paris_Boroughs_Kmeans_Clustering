This is the final project of IBM's professional certificate in Data Science

For many people, the search for an excellent area to live is an arduous process of investigation into the different areas of one city. The definition of a good area to live into varies from one person to another and so the search for a house or an apartment is in the same way unique to the individual.

In this project we will try to find an optimal neighborhood for a fictional client. This client will have some criteria that will define their ideal area to live in Paris (France). These are the three elements our client wants us to take into account to do our search:

* The apartment should be near a pharmacy
* It should also have a grocery nearby
* And it should not be far from a metro or train station

Based on the problem we are trying to solve we will need geospatial data such as the list of neighborhoods in Paris and their latitude and longitude coordinates. Also, we will need venue data in relation to the criteria of the ideal area to live given by the user.

Following data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:

* coordinate of each parisian borough will be extracted from the French government's Open Platform for French Public Data
* number of pharmacies, groceries and metro stations and their location in every neighborhood will be obtained using Yelp API
